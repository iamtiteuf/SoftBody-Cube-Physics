First Try at Soft Body Physics of a Cube
This project represents an initial dive into simulating soft body dynamics, specifically focusing on a deformable cube. Utilizing C++, OpenGL for rendering, GLFW for window management and input handling, GLEW for managing OpenGL extensions, and ImGui for creating the graphical user interfaces. The project is open-source.

Key Technologies Used:
C++: Provides the foundation for the project's structure and logic.
OpenGL: Enables the rendering of the cube and its deformation effects.
GLFW: Manages the application window and handles user input.
GLEW: Facilitates the use of modern OpenGL features through extension wrangling.
ImGui: Offers a straightforward approach to implementing graphical user interfaces for real-time interaction and visualization.
